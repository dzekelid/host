description: Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name
  System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely
  reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating
  names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers
  use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6 as well.Amazon
  Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS &ndash;
  such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3
  buckets &ndash; and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of
  AWS. You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks to route traffic
  to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health of your application
  and its endpoints. Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow makes it easy for you to manage
  traffic globally through a variety of routing types, including Latency Based Routing,
  Geo DNS, and Weighted Round Robin&mdash;all of which can be combined with DNS Failover
  in order to enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures. Using
  Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow&rsquo;s simple visual editor, you can easily manage
  how your end-users are routed to your application&rsquo;s endpoints&mdash;whether
  in a single AWS region or distributed around the globe. Amazon Route 53 also offers
  Domain Name Registration &ndash; you can purchase and manage domain names such as
  example.com and Amazon Route 53 will automatically configure DNS settings for your
  domains.

- name: AWS Route 53 API - Create Hosted Zone
  x-api-slug: 20130401hostedzone-post
  description: Creates a new public hosted zone, used to specify how the Domain Name
    System (DNS)routes traffic on the Internet for a domain, such as example.com,
    and its subdomains. ImportantPublic hosted zones can't be converted to a private
    hosted zone or vice versa.Instead, create a new hosted zone with the same name
    and create new resource recordsets.Send a POST request to the /2013-04-01/hostedzone
    resource. The request body must include a documentwith a CreateHostedZoneRequest
    element. The response returns theCreateHostedZoneResponse element containing metadata
    about the hostedzone.Fore more information about charges for hosted zones, see
    Amazon Route 53 Pricing.Note the following:You can't create a hosted zone for
    a top-level domain (TLD).Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA record
    and four NS records for the zone.For more information about SOA and NS records,
    see NS and SOA Records that Amazon Route 53 Creates for a Hosted Zone in the Amazon
    Route 53 Developer Guide.If your domain is registered with a registrar other than
    Amazon Route 53, you must update thename servers with your registrar to make Amazon
    Route 53 your DNS service. For more information, seeConfiguring Amazon Route 53
    as your DNSService in the Amazon Route 53 Developer's Guide.After creating a zone,
    its initial status is PENDING. This means that itis not yet available on all DNS
    servers. The status of the zone changes to INSYNCwhen the NS and SOA records are
    available on all Amazon Route 53 DNS servers. When trying to create a hosted zone
    using a reusable delegation set, specify anoptional DelegationSetId, and Amazon
    Route 53 would assign those 4 NS records for the zone, instead ofallotting a new
    one.

  description: 'Create, change, update, or delete authoritative DNS information on
    all Amazon Route 53 servers.Send a POST request to:             /2013-04-01/hostedzone/Amazon
    Route 53 hosted ZoneID/rrset resource. The request body must include a document
    with aChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element. The request body contains a list
    ofchange items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional
    changes.When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource record sets, Amazon
    Route 53 either makes all or none of thechanges in a change batch request. This
    ensures that Amazon Route 53 never partially implements theintended changes to
    the resource record sets in a hosted zone. For example, a change batch request
    that deletes the CNAME record forwww.example.com and creates an alias resource
    record set for www.example.com. Amazon Route 53 deletesthe first resource record
    set and creates the second resource record set in a singleoperation. If either
    the DELETE or the CREATE action fails, thenboth changes (plus any other changes
    in the batch) fail, and the original CNAMErecord continues to exist.ImportantDue
    to the nature of transactional changes, you can''t delete the same resourcerecord
    set more than once in a single change batch. If you attempt to delete the same
    changebatch more than once, Amazon Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.NoteTo
    create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either thetraffic
    flow visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic
    policies andtraffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy,
    then associate thetraffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com)
    or subdomain names (suchas www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple
    hosted zones. You can roll backthe updates if the new configuration isn''t performing
    as expected. For more information, seeUsing Traffic Flow to Route DNSTraffic in
    the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.Use ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform
    the following actions:                  CREATE: Creates a resource record set
    that has the specified values.                  DELETE: Deletes an existing resource
    record set that has the specified values.                  UPSERT: If a resource
    record set does not already exist, AWS createsit. If a resource set does exist,
    Amazon Route 53 updates it with the values in the request. The values that you
    need to include in the request depend on the type of resource record set that
    you''re creating, deleting, or updating:            Basic resource record sets
    (excluding alias, failover, geolocation, latency, and weighted resource record
    sets)                           Name                                 Type                                 TTL                           Failover,

    (for failover, geolocation, latency, and weighted resource record sets)When you
    submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Amazon Route 53 propagates your changes
    to all of the Amazon Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are
    propagating, GetChange returns a status of PENDING. When propagation is complete,
    GetChange returns a status of INSYNC. Changes generally propagate to all Amazon
    Route 53 name servers in a few minutes. In rare circumstances, propagation can
    take up to 30 minutes. For more information, see GetChange       For information
    about the limits on a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, see Limits in the Amazon
